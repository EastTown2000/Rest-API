what is already implemented on the server?
  I presumed a local flask instance would suffice for mvp and would implement a connection to existing server when shown where to send the data

are there any requirements for integrations for the api?
  I presumed no integrations

are there any specifications for the data (unique, formatting)?
  I presumed no additional specifications
